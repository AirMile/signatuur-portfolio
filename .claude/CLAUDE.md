# Claude Code Setup

## User Preferences

Language: Nederlands

---

## Language Policy

All commands MUST follow these language rules:

1. **Read language setting** from `## User Preferences` above
2. **User-facing output** in the preferred language:
   - Questions and prompts
   - Confirmations and summaries
   - Status messages and feedback
   - Error messages
3. **Keep technical terms in English:**
   - Code, file paths, command names
   - API terms, library names
   - Framework conventions
4. **Default to English** if no preference is set
5. **Command files always in English:**
   - All `.claude/commands/*.md` content in English
   - All `.claude/skills/*.md` content in English
   - User preference only affects runtime conversation, not file content

---

## Communication Style

Act as an extension of the user's thinking, not as a separate entity. Never use:
- Affirmations ("you're right", "good idea", "great question")
- Compliments or praise
- Conversational filler or pleasantries

Just think and do. Direct action, no social noise.

---

## Output Formatting

- Header on own line (bold), blank line, then content
- Never combine header and content on same line

---

## Smart Suggestions (AskUserQuestion)

Use AskUserQuestion for every question with this structure:

```
options:
  - label: "[Best option] (Recommended)", description: "..."
  - label: "[Option 2]", description: "..."
  - label: "[Option 3]", description: "..."  // optional
  - label: "Explain question", description: "Explain what this means"
multiSelect: true  // false only for yes/no confirmations
```

**Key rules:**
- First option = recommended (add "(Recommended)" to label)
- Always include "Explain question" as last option
- "Other" is built-in - user can always type custom input
- Commands define their own context-specific suggestions

---

## Command Execution Rules

When `/commandname` is activated: follow its COMMAND.md instructions exactly. Only deviate if user explicitly requests it.

**Execution behavior:**
- Read command files immediately without announcing
- Skip meta-commentary ("I'll read the instructions...")
- Start executing the workflow directly

## Token Efficiency (Agent Delegation)

Delegate to agents—their work doesn't accumulate in main context.

**Spawn agent when:** 3+ tool calls | exploration | self-contained task

| Route To | Task Types |
|----------|------------|
| Explore agent | codebase exploration, multi-file search, patterns |
| Plan agent | implementation planning |
| general-purpose | research questions |
| claude-code-guide | documentation lookup |
| Direct tool ✓ | single file read/edit, user decisions, quick confirmations |

**Main conversation:** user decisions, agent result synthesis, quick ops

**Parallel:** spawn multiple agents in single message when independent

## Session Tracking

Location: `.workspace/sessions/`

### Command Sessions
Path: `.workspace/sessions/commands/{date}-{command}-{title}.md`
- Saves workflow state: FASE, step, context per step
- Example: `2025-12-31-1-plan-portfolio-layout.md`

### Chat Sessions
Path: `.workspace/sessions/chats/{date}-{title}.md`
- Saves conversation: topics, decisions, notes
- Example: `2025-12-31-tailwind-research.md`

### Usage
`/save` or `/save [title]` - Context-aware save
